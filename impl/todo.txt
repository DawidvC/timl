Done. 1. Remove bsort from Eq 
Done. 2. 'msg' in 'str_error' should be of (string list)
Done. 3. split 'case' syntax into 'case', 'sumcase' and 'unpack'
Done. 4. 'case' and 'unpack' should allow omitting return-clause and try to forget unescapable variables (like what 'let' does)
Done. 5. Distill the 'bind' pattern
Done. 6. Disallow impredicative universal types
Done. 7. Type inference
Done. 8. Idx inference
9. Allow [datatype] to have idx arguments that don't change.
Done. 10. Multi-argument idx functions.
Done. 11. Add an optional idx to [Quan], to link the remaining unification variables in types and the witnesses found by the Master Theorem solver.
Done. 12. Infer by Master Theorem then check.
Done. 13. Single variable Master Theorem case.
Done. 14. Error line number on multiple files.
Done. 15. Make linking between inferred existential variable values and types better.
Done. 16. Copy function signature annotation to case annotation
16. Have module system.
17. Remove unit and product types from the language, and have standard library.
18. Example: Tree flatten.
19. Example: Insertion sort.
20. Have reference and arrays.
21. RB-tree insertion.
22. RB-tree search.
23. Braun tree.
24. A bug of position reporting when I change bigO spec of msort in msort.timl from [$m * $n * log2 $n] to [$n * log2 $n].
25. 'return _ using' works but 'return using' doesn't in msort.timl and tree.timl.
26. Change syntax order of function name and [t] declares.
27. Figure out how to infer [tree_map] and [tree_foldl].
