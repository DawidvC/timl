This paper gives a brief overview on the Hypervisor with a special focus on verification related challenges this kind of low-level software poses. It discusses how the design of VCC addresses these challenges, and highlights some specific issues of the Hypervisor verification and how they can be solved with VCC.},

VeriFast takes as input a number of source files annotated with method contracts written in separation logic, inductive data type and fixpoint definitions, lemma functions and proof steps. The verifier checks that (1) the program does not perform illegal operations such as dividing by zero or illegal memory accesses and (2) that the assumptions described in method contracts hold in each execution. Although VeriFast supports specifying and verifying deep data structure properties, it provides an interactive verification experience as verification times are consistently low and errors can be diagnosed using its symbolic debugger. VeriFast and a large number of example programs are available online at: http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/~bartj/verifast},

    abstract = {{Proof-by-reflection is a well-established technique that em- ploys decision procedures to reduce the size of proof-terms. Currently, decision procedures can be written either in Type Theory--in a purely functional way that also ensures termination-- or in an effectful program- ming language, where they are used as oracles for the certified checker. The first option offers strong correctness guarantees, while the second one permits more efficient implementations. We propose a novel technique for proof-by-reflection that marries, in Type Theory, an effectful language with (partial) proofs of correctness. The key to our approach is to use simulable monads, where a monad is simulable if, for all terminating reduction sequences in its equivalent effectful computational model, there exists a witness from which the same reduction may be simulated a posteriori by the monad. We encode several examples using simulable monads and demonstrate the advantages of the technique over previous approaches.}},

While these extensions were developed to support a particular proof methodology - small-scale reflection - most of them actually are of a quite general nature, improving the functionality of Coq in basic areas such as script layout and structuring, proof context management, and rewriting. Consequently, and in spite of the title of this document, most of the extensions described here should be of interest for all Coq users, whether they embrace small-scale reflection or not.}},

abstract = "Various formulations of constructive type theories have been proposed to serve as the basis for machine-assisted proof and as a theoretical basis for studying programming languages. Many of these calculi include a cumulative hierarchy of âuniversesâ, each a type of types closed under a collection of type-forming operations. Universes are of interest for a variety of reasons, some philosophical (predicative vs. impredicative type theories), some theoretical (limitations on the closure properties of type theories) and some practical (to achieve some of the advantages of a type of all types without sacrificing consistency.) The Generalized Calculus of Constructions (CCÏ) is a formal theory of types that includes such a hierarchy of universes. Although essential to the formalization of constructive mathematics, universes are tedious to use in practice, for one is required to make specific choices of universe levels and to ensure that all choices are consistent. In this paper we study several 
problems associated with type checking in the presence of universes in the context of CCÏ. First, we consider the basic type checking and well-typedness problems for this calculus. Second, we consider a formulation of Russell and Whitehead's âtypical ambiguityâ convention whereby universe levels may be elided, provided that some consistent assignment of levels leads to a correct derivation. Third, we consider the introduction of definitions to both the basic calculus and the calculus with typical ambiguity. This extension leads to a notion of âuniverse polymorphismâ analogous to the type polymorphism of ML. Although our study is conducted for CCÏ, we expect that our methods will apply to other variants of the Calculus of Constructions and to type theories such as Constable's V3. "
